Version 1.5 build date: January 2021

Project from my first course on programming in Java where I had to implement functionalities such as:
CRUD, Serialization, Comparators, GUI

In this project I made functionalities for a university which had to do with list of students, workers and courses.
The GUI itself isn't really the best as I wasn't experienced with making good UI but at least now I can see its flaws.
